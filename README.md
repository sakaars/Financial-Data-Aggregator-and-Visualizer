# Financial-Data-Aggregator-and-Visualizer
# Overview 

The Financial Data Aggregator and Visualizer is a tool designed to fetch, aggregate, and visualize financial data for analysis. This project leverages APIs to retrieve real-time stock market data, processes it using cloud technologies, and provides insightful visualizations.

# Features

Real-Time Data Fetching: Uses APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub) to fetch stock market data.

Cloud Storage: Stores data in AWS S3 for scalable and reliable storage.

Data Aggregation: Processes large datasets efficiently using Apache Spark.

Visualization: Displays metrics like P&L, balance sheet trends, and capital allocation using Matplotlib and Plotly.

Extensibility: Can integrate with Snowflake and other cloud solutions for advanced analytics.

# Technologies Used

Python: Data fetching, aggregation, and visualization.

Java: Optional integration for backend logic.

RESTful APIs: Data fetching.

React.js: Frontend visualization (optional, not covered in Colab).

Apache Spark: High-speed data aggregation.

AWS S3: Cloud storage.

# Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed

AWS CLI configured

Kaggle API for dataset access

Steps

# Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-data-aggregator.git
cd financial-data-aggregator

Install required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

aws configure

(Optional) Download a dataset from Kaggle:

Upload your Kaggle API key (kaggle.json) to the project directory.

Run the following in your terminal or Colab notebook:

kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-name>

Usage

Fetch Real-Time Stock Data

Update the API key and symbol in the script:

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
symbol = 'AAPL'  # Replace with desired stock symbol

Run the fetch_data.py script to retrieve and save data:

python fetch_data.py

Process Data with Apache Spark

Use the provided Spark script to aggregate data:

python process_data_spark.py

Visualize Data

Run the visualization script to generate plots:

python visualize_data.py
